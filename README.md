# Spring_Template
 ## Recent Changes  [Upgrading old dependencies to newest versions.](https://github.com/nighthawkcoders/spring_portfolio/issues/12)  # [Spring Portfolio Starter](https://nighthawkcodingsociety.com/projectsearch/details/Spring%20Portfolio%20Starter)  - Runtime link: https://spring2025.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/ - JWT Login: https://nighthawkcoders.github.io/APCSA/data/login - Jokes endpoint: https://spring.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/    ## Visual thoughts  - Starter code should be fun and practical - Organize with Bootstrap menu  - Add some color and fun through VANTA Visuals (, halo, solar, net) - Show some practical and fun links (hrefs) like Twitter, Git, Youtube - Show student project specific links (hrefs) per page - Show student About me pages  ## Getting started  - Clone project and open in VSCode - Verify Project Structure to use a good Java JDK (adoptopenjdk:17) - Play or entry point is Main.java, look for Run option in code.  This eanbles Spring to load - Java source (src/main/java/...) has Java files.  Find "controllers" path, these files enable HTTP route and HTML file relationship. - HTML source (src/main/resources/...) had templates and supporting files.  Find index.html as this file is launched by defaul in Spring.  Other HTML files are loaded by building an "@Controller"  ## IDE management  - A ".gitignore" can teach a Developer a lot about Java runtime.  A target directory is created when you press play button, byte code is generated and files are moved into this location. - "pom.xml" file can teach you a lot about Java dependencies.  This is similar to "requirements.txt" file in Python.  It manages packages and dependencies.  ## .env files - In order to run this project locally, a .env file should be set up with the appropriate variables: - GAMIFY_API_URL - GAMIFY_API_KEY   ## Person MVC ![Class Diagram](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/26219a16-e3dc-45e3-af1c-466763957dce)  - Basically there is a rough MVCframework. - The webpages act as the view. These pages can view details about the users, and request the controller to change details about them - The controller is mainly "personViewController" for the backend, but other controllers include "personApiController" for the front end. - Techincally the image is wrong, "personDetailsService" is a controller. It is used by other controllers to change the database, so it seemed more accurate to call it a part of the model, rather than a controller. - The person.java is the pojo (object) that is used for the database schema.
